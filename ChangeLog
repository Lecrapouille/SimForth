January 2020: version 0.1
        * Import initial code of SimForth from the SimTaDyn project.
	* SimForth was tested in basic spreadsheets in replacement of Visual Basic.
	* Can manage: interpret code from strings and files. has a basic system words,
	  can call C functions (integer params), inclusion of files,
	  code tracer, colorful dictionary display.
	* Are not managed: words such as DOES> ." CONSTANT, structures.
	* Dictionary rooms is bytes. Little and big endian are managed. Dictionary can
	  be saved and loaded.

April 2020: version 0.2
        * Reworked version of SimTaDyn Forth: the code has been totally remade.
	* Unit tests have been added to the project as well as continous integration.
	* Faster execution time over version 0.1.
	* Interactive prompt added with word auto-completion.
	* More user firendly tracer.
	* Data stack cells are union between integer and float can hold pointers to C functions.
	* Can execute simple Forth scripts such a displaying Legacy-OpenGL primitives.
	* Dictionary rooms are 16-bits words.
	* More system words have been added such as ."
	* Are not managed: words such as DOES> CONSTANT, structures.
	* Regressions: little/big endian compatibility. Cannot store bytes directly in the dictionary.

??? : version 0.3
	* Minimalist core system such as <BUILDS DOES> VALUE DEFER FORK.
	* Follow standard: check words before numbers.
	* Update compilation for MacOS X, Msys2.
	* Remove utils folder: use git clone instead.
	* Add GTK+ IDE, add spreadsheet using Forth instead of Basic.
	* API evolution, show dictionary and tracer.
        * Fix multilines paste and Windows carriage return.
