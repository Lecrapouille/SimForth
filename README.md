# SimForth

Moving the Forth interpreter of https://github.com/Lecrapouille/SimTaDyn to a separated git repo. Note this Forth is, for the moment, not a rigorous interpreter. I made it for learning Forth and modifed for interpreting scripts in SimTaDyn spreadsheets. [More information](https://github.com/Lecrapouille/SimForth/blob/master/doc/forth.md).

Anyway it can be used as standalone Forth interpretor either in a Linux console or inside a GTK+ window.

- GTK+
