# Learning Forth

There are several good websites and books introducing the Forth language:

* [Starting Forth](https://www.forth.com/starting-forth/) well written for discovering this language for beginners.
* [Forth](https://www.amazon.com/FORTH-W-P-SALMAN/dp/0387912568/), W.P. Salman,
  O. Tisserand, B. Toulout Edition Macmillan (English version) or Eyrolles
  (french version) 1983. An excellent book for understanding how Forth works
  internally. Contains enough information to implement its own interpreter. Note
  that the 1983 french version has more typos than the English version (the 2nd
  revision is 1984 but I do not have it). ISBN-13: 978-0387912561, ISBN-10:
  0387912568
* [JonesForth](http://git.annexia.org/?p=jonesforth.git;a=blob;f=jonesforth.S;h=45e6e854a5d2a4c3f26af264dfce56379d401425;hb=HEAD)
  excellent tutorial on how to implement a Forth (in easy assembly) and how Forth is
  implemented.
* [Thinking Forth](http://thinking-forth.sourceforge.net/) how to well write Forth code.

The second link is my favorite book, followed by the JonesForth tutorial: they
complete themselves. My attempt to teach Forth in French
